# Git Operations Rules

## Rule (CRITICAL)

These rules MUST ALWAYS be followed when performing git operations.

### git unstage

Use `git unstage` to reset the staging area. Do not pass any options.

```bash
git unstage
```

### git undo

Use `git undo` to undo the last commit. Do not pass any options.

```bash
git undo
```

### git stash

Do not use shorthand. Use explicit commands:

- To save changes: `git stash push` (not `git stash`)
- To restore: `git stash apply` (not `git stash pop`)

Before stashing, stage any new (untracked) files with `git add` so they are tracked; otherwise they will not be included in the stash.

```bash
git add <new-files>
git stash push -m "<message>" -- <paths>
```
